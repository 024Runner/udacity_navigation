<h2>What Is Deep Reinforcement Learning</h2>
According to Wikipedia, Reinforcement Learning (RL) 'is an area of machine learning concerned with software taking actions so as to maximize a cumulative reward.'  Ultimately, RL is about 'building code that can perform complex tasks by itself.'  Deep Reinforcement Learning extends on the aforementioned 'by using a deep neural network and without explicitly designing the state space.'
