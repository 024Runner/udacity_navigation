<h2>What Is Deep Reinforcement Learning</h2>

According to Wikipedia, Reinforcement Learning (RL) 'is an area of machine learning concerned with software taking actions so as to maximize a cumulative reward.'  Ultimately, RL is about 'building code that can perform complex tasks by itself.'  Deep Reinforcement Learning extends on the aforementioned 'by using a deep neural network and without explicitly designing the state space.'

<h2>Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree</h2>

This nanodegree teaches cutting-edge Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms â€” from Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) to train agents to walk, drive, or perform other complex tasks, and to build a robust portfolio of Deep Reinforcement Learning projects.  Nanodegree milestones include three projects, all of which have detailed requirements and instructions and all of which use the Unity Machine Learning Agents (ML-Agents) toolkit

The first project requires training an agent to collect yellow bananas while avoiding blue bananas.
