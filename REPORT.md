<h1>Abstract</h1>
<h2>Deep Q-Networks</h2>

Deep neural networks act as function approximators.  Specifically, Deep Q-Networks are multi-layered neural networks
that for a given state output a vector of action values with the max value indicating the action to take.  Reward changes are fed back as the reinforcement signal at each time step.  Hence, it stands to reason that in the beginning actions are vastly innapropriate because the neural network is initialized with random values.
